## auto_28ms.c:
- Uses a consistent interval for clicking, as defined by `CLICK_DELAY_MS` (you may change that variable depending on your needs). It listens for a key press `VK_ADD` (NumpadAdd) to start and stop clicking. There is a small delay in the main loop to reduce CPU usage.
- Delay of 28ms.
- Activation with Numpad Add key
